Place your splash logo image here as `splash_logo.png`.

You uploaded a logo image in the chat — if you want me to write that file into the repo, re-attach it and I'll add it at `assets/images/splash_logo.png` for you.

Current splash references `assets/images/splash_logo.png` in `lib/presentation/splash/splash_screen.dart` and `pubspec.yaml` already declares the asset.
